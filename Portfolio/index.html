      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>

        Hi there! I'm Aman Khan, a passionate 3rd year Computer Engineering student at PDEA College of Engineering, Pune. 
        
        My academic journey has fueled my interest in emerging technologies, particularly Data Science and FinTech. 
        
        I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and explore the potential of these fields to solve real-world challenges.
        
        Beyond academics, I actively engage in personal projects to gain practical experience. 
        
        Currently, I'm working on several Product Management System (PMS) products, including one focused on the XAU/USD (gold) pair. This project allows me to combine my technical skills with my understanding of financial markets.
        
        I'm always eager to connect with individuals who share my interests and learn from their experiences. 
        
        Feel free to reach out and say hello!
